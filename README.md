> **Current Status:** In Active Development / Alpha Testing  
> **Estimated Arrival:** Q1 2026

**The game has changed. Standard manual mappers are no longer enough to bypass modern, AI-driven telemetry and heuristic scanners.**

**Trevor Injector 2026 is a complete architectural reimagining, designed to provide the highest level of OPSEC and execution stealth available in the public domain.**

# 🧬 Metamorphic Engine v2
In **Trevor Injector 2026**, signatures are obsolete. Our new engine ensures that no two binaries are ever the same.
* **Code Mutation:** Every build reshuffles its internal function order and registers used.
* **Junk Instruction Insertion:** Dynamically injected NOP-sleds and mathematical noise break pattern recognition.
* **Variable Entry Points:** The execution flow changes with every session, rendering static entry-point analysis useless.

# 🔐 Quantum-Resistant Logic (PQC)
We are integrating **Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC)** not just for hype, but for real-world analysis resistance.
* **Lattice-Based Opaque Predicates:** Utilizing "Learning With Errors" (LWE) mathematical problems to protect the injector's decision-making flow. 
* **Anti-Emulation:** These quantum-secure mathematical mazes are computationally expensive for AV sandboxes to solve, causing them to time out or fail during heuristic analysis.
* **Logic Shield:** Crucial injection steps are locked behind these PQC barriers, protecting the source's "how-to" from modern decompilers.

# 🌑 Threadless Execution & Hijacking
The most dangerous part of injection is the creation of a new thread. **Trevor 2026** eliminates this risk.
* **APC/Context Hijacking:** We've moved away from `CreateRemoteThread`. The injector now "borrows" existing, legitimate threads from the target process to execute your payload.
* **VAD Stealth:** Advanced memory allocation techniques to mask the `MEM_COMMIT` regions from simple memory scanners.

# 🤖 Smart Telemetry Monitor
A new, lightweight "Sentinel" module that scans your system's "heat" before acting.
* **Hook Detection:** Identifies if system APIs are being monitored by EDRs.
* **Safety Windows:** Analyzes system activity to find the optimal micro-second to perform the mapping, avoiding detection by behavior-based triggers.

### 1. Educational and Research Purpose
**Trevor Injector 2026** is an open-source project developed strictly for **educational, academic, and security research purposes**. Its primary objective is to demonstrate the implementation of:
* **Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC)** within low-level systems.
* **Metamorphic code generation** and execution flow mutation.
* **Advanced Windows Internals**, including manual mapping and asynchronous procedure calls (APC).

### 2. No Warranty and Limitation of Liability
The software is provided **"AS IS"**, without warranty of any kind, express or implied. In no event shall the authors or copyright holders be liable for any:
* Direct, indirect, or incidental damages.
* System instability, data loss, or hardware failure.
* Legal consequences resulting from the use or misuse of the source code.

### 3. Compliance and Ethical Use
The author **does not condone, support, or encourage** the use of this software for any illegal activities or violations of third-party agreements. 
* **Terms of Service (ToS):** Users are solely responsible for ensuring that their use of this tool does not violate the ToS of any third-party software or online service.
* **Local Laws:** You must ensure that your use of this software complies with the cyber-security and privacy laws of your jurisdiction.

### 4. Technical Risk Acknowledgment
Operating at the kernel and memory level involves high-risk procedures. The use of **Thread Context Hijacking**, **VAD Manipulation**, and **Direct Syscalls** can be flagged by security software as malicious behavior. The author is not responsible for any "bans," account terminations, or blacklisting resulting from the use of these techniques in production environments.

### 5. Intellectual Property
While the project is public, all contributions and original logic regarding the **PQC Sentinel** and **Lattice-based shields** are provided under the project's specific license. Any commercial use or redistribution must maintain the original attribution and legal notices.
